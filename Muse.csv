This would be staffed either by an experienced manager from one of our existing countries, or possibly the new country scout can grow into this role.</li>

From day one, Old Navy was a revolution. We were something the world had never seen - fabulous, affordable fashion. We didn't take ourselves too seriously, and we broke the industry's rules. We said fashion didn't have to be just for rich people - it could be for everyone. We opened our first store in 1994 in San Francisco and have been on a roll ever since. Today, customers can shop for their must-have fashion essentials online as well as in one of our 1,000+ stores located globally.</p>
<p>When you work at Old Navy, you’re choosing a different path (and a pretty awesome one at that). We believe that style and quality should be accessible to everyone and we work hard to make that possible. Truth is, in fashion, it’s easy to be exclusive. It takes a lot more creativity, guts and drive to be inclusive. What we believe in today is exactly what we believed in when we started: we’re on a mission to democratize fashion and make shopping fun again. Sound good to you?</p>

<p>TNTP seeks a full-time Communications Manager – Publications for our Communications &amp; Publications Department. This position can be based in a home office anywhere in the U.S. or from the TNTP central office in Brooklyn, NY.    </p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>TNTP is a national nonprofit founded by teachers that believes our nation’s public schools can offer all children an excellent education. Today we’re a diverse team from a wide range of fields, united by a fierce commitment to helping school systems end educational inequality and achieve their goals for students. We work at every level of the public education system to attract and train talented teachers and school leaders, ensure rigorous and engaging classrooms, and create environments that prioritize great teaching and accelerate student learning.</p>
<p>Our Communications &amp; Publications Department works to position TNTP as the nation’s most authoritative voice on effective teachers. The department is responsible for TNTP's communications, public relations, and marketing efforts – including publishing TNTP’s influential blog and nationally acclaimed research and policy papers, such as The Mirage (2015), The Irreplaceables (2012) and The Widget Effect (2009), and Room to Run (2016), TNTP’s first multimedia feature. In addition to the TNTP Blog, reports and papers, TNTP’s publications strategy includes a strong social media element.</p>
<p><strong>Who We Want</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for amazing people who have diverse backgrounds and experiences, are inspired by our mission and are highly motivated to change children’s lives through education. If you’ve been pegged as a problem solver, have a strong eye for detail, and proven you thrive in a fast-paced environment, you’ll be right at home here. We’re looking for talented people who learn from failure and overcome adversity, cultivate strong relationships, and push themselves, their work and the people around them to the next level. </p>
<p>As Communications Manager – Publications, you will work closely with staff across the Communications &amp; Publications department to plan, write, edit and design publications and the TNTP Blog in a way that meets TNTP’s extremely high standards. You will support releases and help identify and develop new publications opportunities, but will be most closely focused on collaborating with other TNTP staff to write content that will effectively engage a wide range of audiences, from teachers to educational leaders to government officials and community members. </p>
<p><strong>We expect our Communications Manager – Publications to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be an amazing writer. You are able to write and edit content, often on a tight timeline, that appeals to readers, advances arguments, and inspires action. You have proven experience in a communications-related position and excel at distilling complex content into simple, clear prose. You also understand the value of visual elements in telling a story.</li>
<li>Connect the dots. You’ll use your problem-solving skills to propose ideas for blog posts and new publications—and then you’ll make those ideas happen. Ambiguity doesn’t bother you; just the opposite, you thrive on it. Your creative instincts and strategic skills will help you deal with vague situations and develop new approaches with limited guidance.</li>
<li>Adeptly manage complex projects and people. You have a strong ability to build relationships and manage projects involving multiple people. You’ll be expected to influence and coordinate a wide range of TNTP staff and leadership team members who play an important role in developing and reviewing publications and the TNTP Blog. You’re able to work well with anyone. </li>
<li>Embrace a fast-moving organization. Deadlines, changing priorities and new projects don’t scare you. Instead, they inspire you to rise to the occasion. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You'll Do</strong></p>
<p>The Communications Manager - Publications will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write and edit outstanding content that maintains TNTP’s high standards for substance and style. Content includes, but is not limited to, blog posts, reports, op-eds, talking points and messages for staff, concepts for infographics, and social media content.</li>
<li>Support the execution of TNTP’s publications strategy, aligning with internal organizational priorities and goals and positioning TNTP as an authoritative voice on issues that transform the teaching profession. You will have a particular focus on the TNTP Blog.</li>
<li>Lead the execution of multi-part blog series, which may include planning and sourcing content, conducting interviews in person or over the phone, coordinating with contractors (such as photographers and audio editors), and thinking about how to tell a cohesive story over time using multiple forms of media.</li>
<li>Provide additional writing support to the Communications &amp; Publications team as necessary.</li>
<li>Anticipate and help ensure the team meets TNTP staff needs for client resources related to TNTP publications.</li>
<li>Support TNTP staff in making and acting on strong connections between publications and opportunities for TNTP to develop new work and services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p>
<p>TNTP offers a competitive salary commensurate with experience in a similar position with the potential for an annual performance-based bonus. We offer a comprehensive benefits plan effective on the first day of employment. We pay 100% of employee-only medical coverage and subsidize the majority of costs for a spouse/domestic partner and children.

So what do these people have in common? They’re problem solvers. They share the desire to help people. And they have a good work ethic. As an independent consultant backed by Aflac, you have the opportunity to run your own business and do the things you love. Put in the work and reap the rewards. That being said, let’s talk about your potential and what becoming an Aflac agent can mean to you. Of course, you probably recognize the Aflac Duck. But that’s only scratching the surface. </p>
<p>Let’s look at what our company really does. Aflac plays a vital role in helping people when they need it most when they’re injured or ill.  Unlike major medical, Aflac pays benefits directly to customers (unless otherwise assigned) — so they have the financial security and control to handle whatever life brings.</p>
<p><strong>Become a Strategic Consultant</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be the go-to benefit-solutions partner for businesses in your community.  As an Aflac associate, you will be a strategic advisor to companies and their employees. Your role will consist of helping business owners figure out the best way to insure employees and guiding individuals to choose the best benefits options. </p>
<p>We also have innovative tools to help you grow your business. Everwell is a web-based enrollment platform designed to enable agents to sell Aflac products, as well as major medical and other ancillary benefits from our partner carriers.</p>
<p><strong>Work with a Winning Team </strong></p>
<p>You’ll be working alongside a group of bright, energetic people who are motivated to help you succeed. As part of our commitment to your development, we’ll provide you with the training you’ll need to help you grow and manage a successful team.</p>
<p><strong>Become a Leader</strong></p>
<p>Being an Aflac agent allows you to own your own business while making a difference. You’ll have the opportunity to advance to a district sales coordinator role where you can grow and develop your own team. </p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity to Give Back</strong></p>
<p>When you join the Aflac sales team, you’ll be part of a passionate and deep tradition of helping those in need in your community. For 20 years, Aflac has actively supported the fight against childhood cancer, and has raised over $100 million to support the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. (Aflac Cancer Center Contribution Report as of Oct 15, 2015)</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Compensation</strong></p>
<p>At Aflac we compensate our associates in several different ways including advanced commission, renewals, stock bonus, and a recruiting bonus. You’ll also receive renewals after the first year with 50% vesting starting at only 2 years. That means as long as the policies you’ve sold continue to be renewed, you will continue to receive that income. There are also great opportunities to participate in contests where you can receive awards, trips, and prizes.  </p>
<p><strong>So if you’re enthusiastic, self-motivated and have an entrepreneurial spirit apply today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Aflac</strong></p>
<p>In the United States, Aflac is the leading provider of voluntary insurance at the worksite. Through its trailblazing One Day Pay initiative, Aflac U.S. can receive, process, approve and disburse payment for eligible claims in one business day.
